#### About this Repository
*** 
Even though the name explains itself, I feel like it's not a bad idea to explain about this repository myself. <br>
This repository contains my older days assignments at school in **Advance Programming** and **Algorithm Design** Courses. I should also mention that some of the codes were just written for self-learning purposes. <br>
I also have some codes about Algorithms in Python that I prefer to push to a devoted repository about algorithms in Python.
